Pararius is derived from the verb parare. Parare means prepare, to complete, to organise, to equip. The English word prepared is derived from Pararius. It is a wonderful metaphor 
for a property for rent in any category. The accommodation is ready to move in to. After signing the agreement (in most cases) the tenant will be able to move in without too much 
hassle of improving the house. Pararius wants to create a place on the internet where the rental market is transparent and where offer and demand will meet each other.
